## install a .so file in library
ldconfig creates, updates, and removes the necessary links and cache (for use by the run-time linker, ld.so) to the most recent shared libraries found in the directories specified on the command line, in the file /etc/ld.so.conf, and in the trusted directories (/usr/lib and /lib).

So, assuming that freeverb.so is located in /home/yourUser/Download directory (folder), create folder in your home:

   mkdir /home/yourUser/myLibrary
and copy freeVerb.so library:

   cp /home/yourUser/Download/freeverb.so /home/yourUser/myLibrary
create a simple file freeverb.conf like this:

   echo "/home/yourUser/myLibrary" > freeverb.conf
Add you configuration file freeverb.conf in /etc/ld.so.conf.d directory (in this directory you can find files as example)

   sudo cp freeverb.conf /etc/ld.so.conf.d
Run ldconfig in order to configure dynamic linker run-time bindings.

   sudo ldconfig
If /etc/ld.so.conf.d doesn't exists, you can add your path at the end of /etc/ld.so.conf file.

At the end, if all went well, you can remove unnecessary file:

   rm freeverb.conf
   rm /home/yourUser/Download/freeverb.so
